-- Sample Queries
--

-- Find name of the oldest crew member
SELECT * FROM crew_members
WHERE age = (SELECT MAX(age) FROM crew_members);


-- Find name of the n-th crew member (second oldest, fifth oldest and so on)
SELECT * FROM crew_members
WHERE age = (SELECT DISTINCT(age) FROM crew_members
      	     ORDER BY age DESC OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1);


-- Find name of the most experienced crew member - that one who knows most aircrafts
SELECT * FROM crew_members
WHERE id = (SELECT crew_member_id FROM history
      	    GROUP BY crew_member_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1);


-- Find name of the least experienced crew member - that one who knows least aircrafts (counting from zero)
-- COMMENT: I know this query doesn't include the crew_members who doesn't have any experience (count = 0) but I couldn't find the way to do it
SELECT * FROM crew_members
WHERE id = (SELECT crew_member_id FROM history
      	    GROUP BY crew_member_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC LIMIT 1);
